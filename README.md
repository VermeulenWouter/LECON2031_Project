This project is private. For any inquiries regarding the use of the code or data, please contact the author. By default, all rights are reserved.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
* Python 3 (tested with Python 3.13)
* Required Python packages (see `requirements.txt`, and a short overview below)

### Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/VermeulenWouter/LECON2031_Project.git
cd LECON2031_Project
```
OR if you don't have git installed, download the ZIP file from GitHub and extract it.

#### Missing files in Moodle submission
Because of their size, the following files are not included in the Moodle submission:

* `Data/Electricity/BE_OffshoreWind_CapacityFactors_SeasonAdjusted.csv` (generated by `PreProcessing/InvestigateProductionData.py`)
* `Data/Weather/WindDirectionsAvg.csv`, `Data/Weather/WindspeedsAvg.csv`, `Data/Weather/WindspeedsAvg_SeasonalityRemoved.csv` (generated by `PreProcessing/InvestigateWindDirection.py` and `PreProcessing/InvestigateWindSpeed.py`)
* Most raw data files in `DataRaw/` (multiple gigabytes in total)

As a result, the following two scripts cannot be run without downloading from github (for the weather) or ENTSO-E (for generation) directly first:
* `PreProcessing/ProcessRawProductionData.py`
* `PreProcessing/ProcessRawWindData.py`

#### Continuing installation

Install Python 3 (if not already installed): https://www.python.org/downloads/

Install required packages (see `requirements.txt`):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the code
To follow the project timeline, run the following scripts (in the given order!) (you can skip the "ProcessRaw..." scripts, those need the raw data files to be downloaded first - skipping them will not break the other scripts):
```bash
python PreProcessing/ProcessRawProductionData.py  # Process raw ENTSO-E data (datafiles not included because too large (multiple gigabytes)) 
```

```bash
python PreProcessing/InvestigateProductionData.py  # Investigate processed production data, check seasonality
```

```bash
python PreProcessing/ProcessRawWindData.py  # Process raw wind data from KNMI and MVB (datafiles not included because too large
```

```bash
python PreProcessing/InvestigateWindDirection.py  # Investigate wind direction data and create final average wind direction file
# Note this script outputs in the console, but also creates a file `Data/Weather/WindDirectionsAvg.csv` with the final average wind direction data, and some plots in `Visualisations/WindPreprocessing/`
```

```bash
python PreProcessing/InvestigateWindSpeed.py  # Investigate wind speed data and create final average wind speed file
# Note this script outputs in the console, but also creates a file `Data/Weather/WindSpeedsAvg.csv` with the final average wind speed data, and some plots in `Visualisations/WindPreprocessing/`
```

```bash
python Analysis/ModelNoWindDirection.py  # Build and evaluate VAR model without wind direction considerations
```

```bash
python Analysis/ModelWithWindDirection.py  # Use ARX / VAR model on data split by wind direction bins and evaluate structural changes
```
