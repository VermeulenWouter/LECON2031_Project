# Folder contents: Visualisations

This folder is created to contain visualizations and plots generated during the analysis of wind data and electricity production data. The visualizations help in understanding patterns, trends, and relationships in the data. Note these visualizations are generated by the scripts in the main directory and are not present in the repository by default.
