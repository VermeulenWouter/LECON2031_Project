# Folder contents: DataRaw

This folder contains the raw data files used in the project. The pre-processed and filtered data files are stored in the `Data/` directory.

*Note: The raw data files on electricity production are quite large (multiple gigabytes). Therefore, we have preprocessed and filtered them to only include the relevant data for our analysis. The processed data files are stored in the `Data/` directory. Those raw data are not sent with this project/included in the repository. In case of questions or if You want acces do not hesitate to email [mailto:wouter.vermeulen@student.uclouvain.be](wouter.vermeulen@student.uclouvain.be).*
